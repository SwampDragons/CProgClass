/*
 * the program cp.c makes a copy of a file. It uses getc () and putc () to do the input and output. 
 * Write four new versions of a file copy program. 
 * Each of the programs should have the same functionality as cp.c 
 *
 * a. In the first version, use fgetc () to do the input and fputc () to do the output. 
 * b. In the second version, use fgets () to do the input and fputs () to do the output. 
 *
 * c. In the third version, use fread () to do the input and fwrite () to do the output. 
 *
 * d. In the fourth version, use fscanf () to do the input and fprintf () to do the output. 
 *
 * e. Compare the sizes of the object code from all five versions of the file copy programs. 
 * If the facilities for testing execution efficiency are available on your system, 
 * test the efficiency of each version. Report on your findings.
